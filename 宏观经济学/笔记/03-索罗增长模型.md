## ∆k/k= s·(y/k) − sδ − n
➢∆k/k: 人均资本增长率 
➢k: is capital per worker 
➢y: is real GDP per worker 
➢y/k: is the average product of capital，=Y/K，也即资本生产力 
➢s: is the saving rate 
➢δ: is the capital depreciation rate 
➢n: is the population (labor force) growth rate

• Production function y = A ·f (k) 
• Solow Growth Equation ∆k/k= s A·f(k)/k − sδ − n

## Solow Growth Model Change in savings rate (s)
• In the short run, an increase in the saving rate s raises the growth rate of capital per worker. 
• This growth rate remains higher during the transition to the steady state.
• In the long run, the growth rate of capital per worker ∆k/k is the same—zero—for any saving rate. 
• In this long-run or steady-state situation, a higher saving rate leads to higher steady state capital per worker, k∗ (not to a change in the growth rate which remains at zero).

## Solow Growth Model Change in technology level (A)
• In the short run, an increase in the technology level, A, raises the growth rates of capital and the growth rates of real GDP per worker. 
• These growth rates remain higher during the transition to the steady state.
• In the long run, the growth rates of capital and real GDP per worker are the same— zero—for any technology level. 
• In this long-run or steady state situation, a higher technology level leads to higher steady-state capital and real GDP per worker, k∗ and y∗ (not to changes in the growth rates which remain at zero).

## Solow Growth Model Change in the labor input (L0)
• In the long run, the growth rates of capital and real GDP per worker are the same—zero—for any initial level of labor input, L(0). 
• The steady-state capital and real GDP per worker, k∗ and y∗, are the same for any L. 
• In the long run an economy with twice as much labor input has twice as much total capital and total real GDP. 
• 记住： ∆k/k和∆y/y为零，即人均资本和人均GDP的 增速为零，不是说∆K/K 或者 ∆Y/Y 为零。资本和 GDP 总量的增速还是等于人口的增速(n) 

## Solow Growth Model Change in population growth rate (n)
• In the short run, a higher n lowers ∆k/k and ∆ y/y. 
• These growth rates remain lower during the transition to the steady state.
• In the steady state, ∆k/k and ∆y/y are zero for any n. 
• A higher n leads to lower steady-state capital and real GDP per worker, k∗ and y∗, (not to changes in the growth rates, k/k and y/y which remain at zero). 
• A change in n does affect the steady-state growth rates of the levels of capital and real GDP, ∆K/K (= ∆k/k+n ) and ∆Y/Y(= ∆y/y+n ).

### 推理
![[Pasted image 20240426194312.png]]
• Economy 1 starts with lower capital per worker than economy 2—k(0)1 is less than k(0)2. 
• Economy 1 grows faster initially because the vertical distance between the s·(y/ k) curve and the sδ + n line is greater at k(0)1 than at k(0)2. 
• Therefore, capital per worker in economy 1, k1, converges over time toward that in economy 2, k2
![[Pasted image 20240426194559.png]]
• The two economies have the same steady-state capital per worker, k*, shown by the dashed blue line. 
• In each economy, k rises over time toward k*. However, k grows faster in economy 1 because k(0)1 is less than k(0)2. 
• Therefore, k1 converges over time toward k2.

• y= A·f (k) and ∆y /y = α·(∆k/k) • ∆k/k was higher initially in economy 1 than in economy 2. 
• Therefore, ∆y/y is also higher initially in economy 1. Hence, economy 1’s real GDP per worker, y, converges over time toward economy 2’s real GDP per worker.

• The Solow Model says that a poor economy—with low capital and real GDP per worker—grows faster than a rich economy. The reason is the diminishing average product of capital(y/k) 
• The Solow model predicts that poorer economies tend to converge over time toward richer ones in terms of the levels of capital per worker (k*) and real GDP per worker(y*).

• Economy 1 starts with lower capital per worker than economy 2，（maybe L(0)1 is bigger） k(0)1 < k(0)2. 
• Assume that economy 1 also has a lower saving rate; s1 < s2. • The two economies have the same technology levels, A, and population growth rates, n. 
• Therefore, k*1 is less than k*2 . 
• It is uncertain which economy grows faster initially. The vertical distance marked with the blue arrows cannot tell which one is longer.

![[Pasted image 20240426200019.png]]
• Economy 1 has a lower starting capital per worker— k(0)1 < k(0)2—and also has a lower steady-state capital per worker— k*1 is less than k*2 . 
• Each capital per worker converges over time toward its own steady-state value: k1 toward k*1 ,and k2 toward k*2 . 
• However, since k*1 is less than k*2 , k1 does not converge toward k2.
### Key Results
✓k* = k*\[ s, A, n, δ, L(0) \] (+) (+) (−) (−) (0) 
✓∆k/k = ϕ\[ k(0) , k*\] (−) (+) 
✓推断：k(0) 和 k\*之间的距离越远，∆k/k就越大。
### Conditional convergence: 条件收敛
✓a lower k(0) predicts a higher ∆k/k, conditional on k*. 
✓两个经济体的稳态k*不同，则k*/ k(0)越大的国家， 就说明这个经济体的当下水平距离其稳态水平越 远，因此这个经济体和人均资本和人均产出的增 长率越高。
### Absolute convergence：绝对收敛
✓the prediction that a lower k(0) raises ∆k/k without any conditioning. 
✓两个经济体的k∗相同，则k(0)低的国家，其经济 增长率更高，因此预期两个经济体会收敛于相 同的稳态。
